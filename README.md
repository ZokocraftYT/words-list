# Multilingual Word Lists & Lookup Scripts  

This repository contains **word lists** in multiple languages, including **French, English, German**, and more. These lists are **not full dictionaries**, but rather **collections of words** that can be useful for various linguistic or computational purposes.  

## 📂 Structure  

- Each language has its own **text file** (e.g., `french.txt`, `english.txt`, `german.txt`), containing a list of words.  
- The word lists come from **various contributors on GitHub** who have shared similar datasets.  
- For each language, there is a **Python script** (e.g., `french.py`, `english.py`, `german.py`) that allows users to **search for words or phrases** in that language.  

## 🔍 How It Works  

1. The Python scripts **ask for a word or phrase** in the specified language.  
2. They then **search for each word** in the corresponding word list.  
3. For each match, the script **returns the line number** where the word appears in the file.  

## 🌍 Supported Languages  

Currently, the repository includes word lists for:  
✅ French  
✅ English  
✅ German  
✅ *(More languages to come!)*  

## 📌 Notes  

- This project is **open-source**, and contributions are welcome!  
- If you have **better word lists** or want to **add a new language**, feel free to submit a **pull request**.  
- Credits go to **various GitHub users** who have compiled and shared their own word lists.

## What next
- A web page is in building. The web page will do what every python files are doing.
